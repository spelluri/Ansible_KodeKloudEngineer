Ansible utilizes SSH connections to communicate with remote hosts. The Nautilus DevOps team intends to employ a unified Ansible manager for overseeing several remote hosts. To streamline operations, they seek to use a common remote user to connect with all remote hosts.


Update the Ansible configuration file located at /home/thor/ansible-t5q5/ansible-t5q5.cfg on the jump host to set a default remote user as deploy. Please refrain from creating a new configuration file.

Note: This is a sample Ansible configuration. If you intend to test an Ansible playbook using this configuration, you may need to explicitly set the ANSIBLE_CONFIG variable.

Solution
1. vi /home/thor/ansible-t5q5/ansible-t5q5.cfg
2. add remote_user = deploy under [defaults] section.
