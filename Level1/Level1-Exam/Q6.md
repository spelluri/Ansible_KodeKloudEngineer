The Nautilus DevOps team is working to create some data on different app servers in using Ansible. They have some specific requirements related to this task. Find below more details about the same:


a. You can utilise the inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory-t4q2, present on the jump host.

b. Create a playbook named /home/thor/playbook/playbook-t4q2.yml to update the permissions of file /opt/file-t4q2.txt to 0444 on all app servers.

Note: Validation will attempt to execute the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory-t4q2 playbook-t4q2.yml. Please ensure the playbook functions correctly with this command alone, without requiring any additional arguments.

Solution:

---
- name: Modify File Permission of File On All App Servers
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: Modify Permission Of File
     ansible.builtin.file:
      path: /opt/file-t4q2.txt
      mode: '0444'
