One of the Nautilus DevOps team members initiated work on testing an Ansible playbook on the jump host. However, the completion stalled after creating the inventory due to higher-priority tasks. We need assistance in resuming this task from where it was left off. Below are the specific details regarding the task at hand.


a. The inventory file located at /home/thor/ansible/inventory-t1q1 appears to have encountered some issues. It requires correction to execute the playbook on App Server 1 within the Stratos DC.

b. Generate a playbook named /home/thor/ansible/playbook-t1q1.yml and add a task to create an empty file named /tmp/file-t1q1.txt on App Server 1.

Note: Ensure the playbook functions seamlessly using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory-t1q1 playbook-t1q1.yml for validation purposes, avoiding any additional arguments during execution.

Solution:

---
- name: Create a Empty File On App Server 1
  hosts: all
  become: true
  
  tasks:
   - name: Create Empty File in /tmp
     ansible.builtin.file:
       path: /tmp/file-t1q1.txt
       state: touch
