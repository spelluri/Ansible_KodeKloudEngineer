why did you use state:present instead of latest . we have to install samba package in this task

Short answer first

👉 state: present is the safest and most correct choice for this task
👉 state: latest is not required and can be risky in automation

Difference between present and latest
State	What it does
present	Installs the package if not already installed
latest	Installs and upgrades the package every time a newer version exists

nterview-grade reasoning 🧠

If asked “Why not latest?”, the correct answer is:

“Because the requirement was to ensure the package is installed, not upgraded. Using present maintains idempotency and avoids unintended changes.”
