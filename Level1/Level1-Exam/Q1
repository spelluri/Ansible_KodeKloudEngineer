The Nautilus DevOps team will be managing multiple hosts using Ansible. Each host possesses unique properties such as hostnames, login credentials, etc. Therefore, a custom inventory file is necessary to manage these hosts efficiently. The team has delineated the following requirements to address this situation.


Ensure that the default inventory path is appropriately modified to point to /home/thor/ansible-t5q6/inventory-t5q6 in the Ansible configuration file located at /home/thor/ansible-t5q6/ansible-t5q6.cfg. Please refrain from creating a new configuration file.

Note: This is a sample Ansible configuration. If you intend to test an Ansible playbook using this configuration, you may need to explicitly set the ANSIBLE_CONFIG variable.

Solution : 
goto /home/thor/ansible-t5q6/ansible-t5q6.cfg. Edit this file 
Add inventory=home/thor/ansible-t5q6/inventory-t5q6
