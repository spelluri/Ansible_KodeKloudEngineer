We plan to utilize various Ansible modules moving forward. To enhance our familiarity, the team intends to practice commonly used modules by creating playbooks for specific tasks.


Create a playbook named /home/thor/ansible/playbook-t1q4.yml on the jump host. Configure the playbook to generate a file named /tmp/file.txt on the jump host itself. Utilize the copy module and ensure the file contains the content: Welcome to the KKE Tests!

Solution:

---
- name: Create a File
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
   - name: Copy a file 
     ansible.builtin.copy:
       dest: /tmp/file.txt      
       content: "Welcome to the KKE Tests!"
