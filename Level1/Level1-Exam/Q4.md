There is data on jump host that needs to be copied on all application servers in Stratos DC. Nautilus DevOps team want to perform this task using Ansible. Perform the task as per details mentioned below:


a. On jump host we already have inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory-t2q1.

b. On jump host create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook-t2q1.yml to copy /usr/src/dba-t2q1/index-t2q1.html file to all application servers at location /opt/dba-t2q1.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory-t2q1 playbook-t2q1.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

Solution:

---
- name: Copy Files To All App Servers
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
   - name: Copy File  usr/src/dba-t2q1/index-t2q1.html
     ansible.builtin.copy:
        src: /usr/src/dba-t2q1/index-t2q1.html
        dest: /opt/dba-t2q1
