a. On jump host we already have an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory-t2q2.

b. On jump host create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook-t2q2.yml to copy /usr/src/dba-t2q2/system-t2q2.txt file to all application servers at location /opt/dba-t2q2 with permissions 0600.

Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory-t2q2 playbook-t2q2.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

Solution :

--- 
- name: Copy File To All Application Servers
  hosts: all
  become: true 
  tasks:
   - name: Copy Files to /opt/dba-t2q2
     ansible.builtin.copy:
       src: /usr/src/dba-t2q2/system-t2q2.txt
       dest: /opt/dba-t2q2
       mode: '0600'
