The Nautilus DevOps team aims to test their Ansible playbooks, stored in the /home/thor/playbook/ directory on the jump host, specifically on app server 1 in the Stratos DC. To facilitate this, the team requires the creation of an inventory file to enable Ansible's connection to the specified app server. Below are the outlined requirements:


a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory-t3q1 on jump host.

b. Add App Server 1 in this inventory.

c. The inventory hostname of the host should be the server name as per the wiki, for example stapp01 for app server 1.

d. The playbook should seamlessly execute using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory-t3q1 playbook-t3q1.yml --list-hosts.

Solution:

1. vi /home/thor/playbook/inventory-t3q1 
2. stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=steve ansible_password='Ir0nM@n'
