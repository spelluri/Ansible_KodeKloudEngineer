The Nautilus DevOps team is working to create some data on different app servers in using Ansible. They want to create some files/directories and have some specific requirements related to this task. Find below more details about the same:


a. Utilise the inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory-t4q5, present on the jump host.

b. Create a playbook named /home/thor/playbook/playbook-t4q5.yml to create a directory named /opt/database-t4q5 with permission 0600 on all App Servers.

Note: Validation will attempt to execute the playbook using the command ansible-playbook -i inventory-t4q5 playbook-t4q5.yml. Please ensure the playbook functions correctly with this command alone, without requiring any additional arguments.
